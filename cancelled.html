        <td class="tdSynopsis">The account is very short (just 4 pages) and relates the events of Friar Juan de Prado's mission to Morocco in the first months of 1631. The author refers that the Franciscan friar had asked for and obtained the necessary licences to travel to Morocco (Azamor and Marrakech) to give assistance and spiritual relief to Christian captives and to carry out a mission of evangelisation of the Moors, together with his co-friar Matías de San Francisco. But the King of Morocco, Muley Abdel Malik, who had granted safe-conduct to the two friars, had died before their arrival and his brother, who had succeeded him on the throne, did not want to recognise the safe-conduct given by his dead brother and took the friars hostage as his slaves. After keeping them in prison for a month, the king gave them the opportunity to be released, on condition that they left as soon as possible to return to Spain, without preaching the Christian religion nor proselytising. But Juan de Prado did not accept, because he had gone to Africa for that purpose and, instead, began to debate with the king of Morocco and to give his arguments attempting to convince him to convert to Christianity. He told him that man can only be saved in the law of Christ and “condemned the falsehood and deception of the Sect of Mohammed”, through which “all Moors are lost and condemned to Hell”. Then the Moroccan king, enraged, attacked him with a dagger and, in an uncontrollable hatred, struck him several times in the chest. Finally, he ordered the almost lifeless body of the friar to be burnt on a pyre, saying to all the Muslims present: “Whoever wants to go to paradise, let him throw a piece of wood on the fire!”.
          The author of the report explicitly speaks of the friar as a “Holy Martyr of Christ”, because he was “condemned to death and burned for the faith” and adds that with his last strength, already engulfed in flames, he continued to preach the Catholic faith until his last breath.</td>

        <td class="tdSynopsis">This work is a hagiography dedicated to Saints Justus and Pastor, also known as the “Holy Children”, or the “young martyrs”. Saints Justus and Pastor died martyrs in 304 A.D., during the great persecution of Diocletian, as children under the age of ten. They were executed in Alcalá de Henares, by order of the governor Dacian, because they refused to abjure Christianity. In the place where they were martyred, years later a chapel was built to house their remains. After the Muslim invasion, the relics of the holy children were taken by Saint Urbicius to the province of Huesca and to Bordeaux (France); in 1568 part of the remains returned to Alcalá, but most of them were kept in Huesca, to which monument a large part of this work is dedicated. His feast day is celebrated on 6 August.</td>
